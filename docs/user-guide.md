## Using Genie AI Assistant

### Getting Started with Natural Language Queries

The Genie AI assistant understands retail terminology and context. Here's how to get the best results:

#### Query Structure

**Be Specific About:**
- Time periods: "last 30 days", "this quarter", "year-to-date"
- Locations: "my store", "West region", "all locations"
- Products: "electronics category", "top 10 SKUs", "seasonal items"
- Metrics: "revenue", "units sold", "margin percentage", "customer count"

#### Example Conversations

**Store Manager:**
```
You: "How are today's sales vs target?"
Genie: "Today's sales are $12,450, which is 98% of your $12,700 target..."

You: "Why are we behind target?"
Genie: "The main drivers are: Electronics down 15% due to stockouts..."

You: "What can I do about the electronics stockouts?"
Genie: "You have 3 critical electronics items out of stock. Tablets and headphones..."
```

**Merchandiser:**
```
You: "Which products need markdown for clearance?"
Genie: "I found 23 products with over 90 days of inventory that should be marked down..."

You: "What markdown percentage would clear them in 30 days?"
Genie: "Based on historical data, a 40% markdown would clear 85% of these items..."
```

#### Tips for Better Results

1. **Start broad, then drill down**: "Show me sales performance" → "Why did electronics drop?" → "Which electronics products specifically?"

2. **Use retail terminology**: Genie understands terms like "sell-through", "turns", "planogram", "SKU velocity"

3. **Ask for recommendations**: "What should I do about..." or "How can I improve..."

4. **Request comparisons**: "vs last year", "compared to other stores", "vs category average"
